## Highlight, Copy, and Share Tool
This is a simple project that allows users to copy selected text from a webpage and share it on social media platforms using a custom React hook. The project demonstrates how to manage text selection and clipboard interactions in a user-friendly way.

### Features:
- **Text Selection**: Users can highlight text and see a copy button appear.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Selected text can be easily copied to the clipboard with a single click.
- **Custom Hook**: The functionality is encapsulated in a reusable React hook (`useSelectionText`), making it easy to integrate into other projects.
- **Social Media Integration**: Users can add social media icons (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) to share selected text directly on their profiles.

### Scope of the Project:
This project can be extended in various ways, including but not limited to:
- **Social Media Sharing**: Implement buttons for sharing the selected text directly to social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook. This could involve using APIs or deep links for these services.
- **Customization**: Allow users to customize the appearance of the copy button and social media icons, making it fit seamlessly into different designs and themes.
- **Additional Functionalities**: Consider adding features like saving the selected text to a database or a local storage option for later retrieval.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Implement features that improve accessibility, such as keyboard shortcuts for copying text or using screen reader-friendly labels.
- **Analytics Integration**: Track how often users copy text or share it on social media for insights into user engagement.

### Built Using:
- **Vite**: A fast development environment and build tool for modern web projects.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for component-based architecture.
- **Plain CSS**: Styling is done using standard CSS, ensuring a lightweight and straightforward design.
